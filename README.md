# Predicting song popularity on Spotify

The project is completed by **a group of 3 people**.

The goal of this project is to perform music popularity prediction using machine learning techniques, specifically Ridge regression and AdaBoost, leveraging Spotify's open dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spotify-popularity-prediction-v2). The dataset comprises various attributes of songs, including acousticness, danceability, energy, tempo, and other features, with popularity as the target variable.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:
- `music.csv`: Dataset containing song attributes and popularity scores from Spotify.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project (You are reading it right now!).
- `spotify.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the notebook.

## Setup and Usage
1. **Setup**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
      ```
   - Navigate to the project directory.
   - Install the required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
   - Launch Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `spotify.ipynb` in your browser.

## Acknowledgment

I extend my gratitude to Spotify for providing the dataset used in this project. This valuable data enables us to explore and analyze machine learning techniques for music popularity prediction. Thank you!
